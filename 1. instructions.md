# Flight Information

Using the included flights.json file, create an API with the below functionality using Node.js. Create a simple React app to call your API and display the flights in a table that can be filtered.

- The API does not require authentication or rate limiting.
- You are welcome to create a database from the json file, or just read from the file (either option
is fine).
- Errors should be caught and handled.
- The dates are strings in DD/MM/YYYY format. Is there a better solution?

## API Functionality

|Example endpoint|Description|
|--|--|
|/api/flights|Return all flights|
|/api/flights/arrivals|Return all arrivals|
|/api/flights/departures|Return all departures|
|/api/flights/flight/BA1440|Return only the flight specified. E.g. BA1440|

## Notes

- Feel free to use your favourite JavaScript framework and libraries. We use Express, but you're welcome to use another if you like
- Please .gitignore the ***node_modules*** directory!
- The solution should be simple, but think about how it could be scaled if it were a production service
- The React frontend doesn't need to be perfectly styled, as long as it is presentable
- Please feel free to contact gary_harrower@edinburghairport.com with any questions you have!

## Submitting

- Please return your solution to gary_harrower@edinburghairport.com with either a git repo link or as a zipped attachment.
- If you would like to create a private repo, please give **gharrower** access!
